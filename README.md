# NER-for-Medical-Context-Named-Entity-Recognition-Model

This repository contains a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model tailored for medical contexts. Using Spacy's methods, I developed and trained this model to identify entities relevant to medical and healthcare domains. The model is trained to recognize various entities such as diseases, treatments, medical procedures, and anatomical terms within medical texts.
